# CodePortfolio
Portfolio with C# script from different Unity projects.

Scripts are examples of what I have done, they are not in any particular order. 

Some are more fine tuned than others.

___
#PlayerPrefSettings - Game settings file, quite messy but works. Would like to improve on this and make it simpler or break it down into smaller components. One of my first and biggest game settings file.

#SelectHandler - Script is used for gamepad input in inventory system to pick up, equip or drop items. One of the scripts which I'm working towards to in other scripts also, so I can have enough, but not too many, comments on what logic is going on in the function.

___
#Health - Player health script

#CameraZoomOut - Script is a simple script for my game start where the camera will move from the player position to further away. Has an option to toggle this effect.

#CartographerScript - Used on an NPC which will help the player to change the size of the playable map

#MapSizesInfo - Applies the data from ScriptableObject MapSize to my component

#SaveSlot - Script for my buttons that I use to display saved data content in Main menu where you can choose which save to load.

#SaveSlotsMenu - Parent script for above that controls the load game menu logic. Contains some of the data fetch and loading logic

#SpriteStateSwap - Used in a button to modify image depending on preferred button status; active or inactive.

#TabButtons - Simple script for tab behavior with mouse

#TabGroup - Parent script for tab logic

#GamepadTabSwitcher - Contains logic for tab switching using a gamepad

#UIManager - Biggest Game UI script that controls most of the UI events. Quite messy, could be more simpler. Would also like to improve this.
