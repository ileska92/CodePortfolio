# CodePortfolio
Portfolio with C# script from different projects.

Scripts are examples of what I have done, they are not in any particular order. 

Some are more fine tuned than others.


#CartographerScript is a used on an NPC which will help the player to change the size of the playable map

#PlayerPrefSettings Game settings file, quite messy but works. Would like to improve on this and make it simpler or break it down into smaller components. One of my first and biggest game settings file.

#SaveSlot is the script for my buttons that I use to display saved data content in Main menu where you can choose which save to load.

#SaveSlotsMenu is the parent script for above that controls the load game menu logic. Contains some of the data fetch and loading logic
